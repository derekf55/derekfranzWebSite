# Easy access to home functionality 
Purpose: This site is designed to allow for easy access to various features and home automations that I have developed around the house.  It has the ability to give different users different levels of access for certain functionality. 
Features:
•	TV Remote – A web based remote for the living room TV.
•	Lamp control – Allows for control of custom light switches in the living room.  Also allows access to my bedroom lights when I am the logged in user.
•	LED control – Allows control of the colored LEDs in the living room.
•	Mario Kart Track Picker – Selects a random track from Mario Kart Wii to keep track selection exiting.
•	Quote Generator – Plays a randomly generated quote from one of our favorite TV shows and plays it out of the living room speaker.
•	Home Management – A feature only enable for me that tells me who is currently at the house using my Wi-Fi presence detection software.
•	Alarm – Another feature only for me that allows me to set an alarm that will trigger a flashing of the lights in the selected room.
Future Plans:
•	Climate controls for the house
•	A way to set an absolute volume rather than just a relative change.
•	More robust testing apparatus.
